I work at the intersection of business, technology, skills development and strategy - driving automation, digital transformation, and industry-aligned education to create sustainable impact.

💡 Automation & AI
As a UiPath Most Valued Professional (MVP), principle developer and solution architect, I specialise in intelligent automation, process optimisation, and AI-driven business solutions, helping organisations unlock efficiency and scalability.

🏢 Business & Strategy
As a certified business analyst, advanced automation developer & solution architect, I help businesses navigate their digitisation and optimisation journeys by implementing automation-driven solutions in access control, process efficiency, and enterprise transformation. As the Director of JPanda Solutions & Tegnika Unlimited, I instill my industry knowledge and standards in developing my own businesses; through these initiatives, I also consult for NTT, CVTS & i1 Solutions, offering strategic insights and execution support for business growth.

📚 Education, Research & Skills Development
I am deeply committed to developing future tech talent and bridging the gap between industry and academia. As Industry Coordinator at Belgium Campus and Researcher at North-West University (NWU), I help students and professionals build future-ready skills while pursuing a PhD in automation governance and strategy. I create and engage in various hackathons, master classes and community events where knowledge sharing is amplified.

🌍 Global Impact & Standardisation
As a Data Analysis & Visualisation Expert for the BRICS Standardisation & Y20 Working Groups, I contribute to global frameworks for responsible tech adoption. I also lead community-driven initiatives through Microsoft & UiPath events, creating accessible pathways for skills development in automation and AI.

🚀 Passion for Skills & Talent Development |
One of my biggest drivers is empowering people with the skills they need to thrive in a digital economy. Whether through community events, research, or consulting, I actively work to decentralise access to quality tech education and help individuals and businesses future-proof their skills.

💻 I enjoy exploring software development, IoT, data engineering, advanced analytics, and business intelligence, constantly evolving at the intersection of technology, business, and education.
